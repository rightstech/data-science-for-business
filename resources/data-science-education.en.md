## 1.3 Can the same human right be written in more than one place?

* Absolutely! You can often find the same human right in more than one place.
* The same right can be placed in more than one human rights treaty.
* This right can also be found in more than one national law at the same time.

---

### 1.3.1 Example

<div class="r-fit-text">The right to equality is contained<br>
 in many treaties and also in national laws,<br>
 such as a country's constitution and other laws.</div>

---

### 1.4.1 Example: The right to education today means that everyone should learn the technological skills needed for work.

Girls and women have the same right to education. Therefore, they should also learn these important technological skills.
Governments are now changing their educational curricula because they realize two important things:
1. everyone needs these skills 
2. these skills are for everyone

## 1.5 What are some of the main UN human rights treaties?

---

### 1.5.1 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), December 10, 1948.

First, the UN issued a declaration. Subsequently, World War II kickstarted things in the modern international human rights system.
This was a declaration, not a treaty. But even this is now considered international law.
Countries decided that they never wanted the atrocities that happened during World War II to be repeated.
Over time, we gained ten international human rights treaties following this declaration.

---

### 1.5.2 Some important human rights treaties for the topic of women in STEM are:

* 1966 – Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, CCPR and its two optional protocols
* 1966 – International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, CESCR
* 1989 - Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC
* 1979 - Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW
* ...and more

===

## 1.6 How do we apply existing human rights treaties to girls and women in STEM?

The mentioned human rights and key treaties also apply to girls and women in STEM.
Governments are updating how they provide education to prepare everyone for today's jobs, and that means girls and women too.

---

## 1.6 How do we apply existing human rights treaties to girls and women in STEM?

Important rights are in human rights treaties and also in our national laws, such as :
* Equality – you will find this right in many, many places. And see CEDAW Articles 2, 10, 11 and 13.
* Education – in most major human rights treaties.
* Information – for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 19
* Right to science – see the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 15

### 3.1.1 What Can Python Do for You?

![Python](./images/python.png)

* In Python, you write commands or instructions in a way that the computer understands.
* It then follows these instructions and responds accordingly. 
* It's like giving the computer a list of tasks. 
* It can make decisions and repeat tasks.

## 3.3 Data in Python

---

### 3.3.1 Variables

```python
favorite_number = 5
```

---

### 3.3.1 Variables (2)


```python
favorite_number = 7
```

Now ```favorite_number``` contains 7 instead of 5.

---

### 3.3.2 Lists (1)

A list of your favorite fruits might look like this:

```python

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

```

---

### 3.3.2 Lists (2)

You can easily add items to the list:

```python
fruits.append('grapes')
print(fruits)
# Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grapes']
```

---

### 3.3.2 Lists (3)

or remove them:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grapes']
fruits.remove('banana')
print(fruits)
# Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'grapes']
```

---

### 3.3.3 Dictionaries

For example, a contact list in Python could be a dictionary:

```python
contact =
{
   'Name': 'John'
  ,'email': 'john@email.com'
  ,'phone': '123-456-7890'
}
```

## 3.4 Libraries in Python

#### Libraries are like special tools in a toolbox

* Pandas : A library that specializes in storing and transforming data.
* Matplotlib : A library that can transform data into graphs to make numerical results more attractive.
* Seaborn : A library that enhances Matplotlib to represent statistical data and more easily identify interesting information.

```python
import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot
import seaborn
```

---

## 3.5 Pandas - Working with Data

![Spreadsheet and Data](./images/3_5_spreadsheet.jpg)

---

### 3.5.1 DataFrame and Series

---

#### 3.5.1.1 DataFrame (1)


You can create a **DataFrame** with a dictionary assigning a name to a list of values:

```python
import pandas

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35],
        'City': ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin']}

df = pandas.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

#### 3.5.1.1 DataFrame (2)

You can also load a computer file, such as an Excel file (in CSV format) and create a DataFrame:

```python
df = pandas.loadCSV("myFile.csv")
print(df)
```

===

## 3.6 Seaborn and Matplotlib – Data Visualization

---

### 3.6.1 What are they used for?

* Matplotlib and Seaborn are two Python **libraries** for data visualization that make it easy to create attractive and informative statistical graphics.

* Both work well with Pandas DataFrames and simplify the process of creating graphs or other types of diagrams.

---

### 3.6.2 Transforming Data into a Graph

```python
# Creating a Pandas DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
         'Age': [25, 30, 35],
         'City': ['London', 'Paris', 'Berlin'],
         'Salary': [70000, 65000, 50000]}
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Seaborn Example - Bar Plot
plot = sns.barplot(x='Name', y='Salary', data=dataframe, palette='viridis')
plot.set(title='Employee Salary Information', xlabel='Employee Name', ylabel= 'Salary')
```
